# PortfolioCompendium
A compendium of work to display for a portfolio in Programming.

Included in this portfolio are projects that I have worked on, that I deemed worthwhile to show off.In addition, there will be scripts and small code work to be included in a Misc folder. For each project, it will be described using the following format:

1. Title
2. Year it was worked on
3. Technology Used (IDE and Languages)
4. My role on said project

## Assignment 1 - Real-Time Messaging System

**Year**: 2019

**Technology Used:** Momentics (Eclipse), VMWare, QNX Neutrino, C

**My Role**: After graduating from Game Development, I wanted to increase my capability, which is why I went immediately in the Computing Science course. This is the result the first assignment we were given for Real-Time Programming, utilizing virtual machines and the QNX kernel to create a Real-Time Messaging System for a mock door entry system. The original specs for the assignment wanted it to work with input and output being direction specific (LEFT_SCAN, GUARD_RIGHT_UNLOCK). I was able to refine the design to reduce the number of inputs and outputs, as well as making the inputs/outputs direction agnostic (DOOR_SCAN, GUARD_UNLOCK). 

## Coral Thief

**Year:** 2016

**Technology Used:** TortoiseSVN, Visual Studio, Unity3D, C#

**My Role:** This was a Capstone (Final) project that was worked on for my last year for the Game Development Program at Algonquin College. Th group I was a part of (Iolite) decided to work on a third-person puzzle adventure game with light combat elements. As for my role on the project, I was a Generalist Programmer. I worked on various tasks such as combat refinement, UI programming, UI design, debugging, etc. I consider this my best first-hand experience working on a group project, commiting tickets, doing daily standups, the overall workflow of game development.

## Abscond

**Year:** 2015

**Technology Used:** Github, Visual Studio, Unity3D, C#

**My Role:** This was a brief little game I did with a handful of friends (some of which I went on to work with for Coral Thief!). The game was a top-down co-op puzzle game, done for the Ottawa Game Jam (OJam). My contribution was partially in the movement controller, although if I will be entirely honest, my work is considerably lower for this project. That being said, I did work on it and thus I wanted to include it.
